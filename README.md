*On average, a single person will visit 130 web pages per day, but what's scary is that an estimated 10% of all websites on the internet are malicious, or out to get you. Seriously, so many websites, hackers, even the government are all on the hunt to invade your computers, phones, etc, to get your personal information to either sell to the highest bidder, or to use against you, and this is why so many people use VPNs, but what do VPNs actually do? They encrypt your data in private sessions so that no one can invade your sessions, see your viewing history or see any of your personal information, that's why you see tons of influencers on the internet promoting them, because it's really the only way to stay safe in today's modern world*
